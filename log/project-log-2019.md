### **R2D34:** Tuesday 2nd April 2019

+ **Notes**
  + Worked mostly with PHP today.  Studying how to use a Templating engine .e.g. Twig. So far so good.

+ **Technologies Used:**  - HTML, CSS, PHP

### **R2D33:** Monday 1st April 2019

+ **Notes**
  + Added Middleware to the MVC Project which completes this simple project. Looking forward to using this project for another practice with a project of my choosing.

  + I'll be using the Slim Framework Tutorial to base this on and refer back to this project if necessary.

  + I also completed the main content for the Regex Practice website. Looking forward to stying this site before thinking about releasing this as a new project.

+ **Technologies Used** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP 
### **R2D32:** Friday 29th March 2019
+ **Notes** 

  + Really pleased to have fixed the PHP problem with routes and loggings for the contact form. Turns out I was returning the view too soon so it was already redirecting to a defunct or blank page. Now I move on!.  :)

  + Went on to learn some things about combining request methods in routes and using named routes. All this for using the Slim Framework in PHP.


+ **Technologies Used** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

### **R2D31:** Thursday 28th March 2019
+ **Notes** - Worked today on the gallery project putting it together in Sass and coding a caption overlay for the images.  It works but not sure why the padding isn't hiding the overflow like it should.
  
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML, CSS

### **R2D30:** Wednesday 27th March 2019

+ **Notes** 

  + Main business of the day... I've spent a lot of time trying to delve into the mvc-framework project. Learned how to add routes in PHP and link the correct content to them.

  + It hasn't gone 100% according to plan though. The post route for the form should be logging an email to a file and redirecting to the thank you page. It isn't.

  + Added some more Regex practice to the repository.  Including boilerplates for the rest of the sections of the page. Should make building the rest of this less labourious :)
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

### **R2D29:** Tuesday 26th March 2019
+ **Notes** - Finished off the library project. It's not finished and not 100% correct as discussed previously, so it'll be going in the new bin folder in this repo. more in the updated readme.md. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

### **R2D28:** Monday 25th March 2019
+ **Notes** - Slightly truncated day today. Building a couple more single page websites today starting with a gallery of projects rather than a slider of images. Tidied up a few things elsewhere too.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

### **R2D27:** Friday 22nd March 2019
+ **Notes:** - Tackling OOP JavaScript again today. It's working but there are some bugs in the log output when testing functionality, calling methods from different classes. More in CodersNotes file. :)
  
+ **Technologies Used:** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
### **R2D26:** Thursday 21st March 2019

+ **Notes:** - 
  +  Added some jQuery that makes the Regex Practice page, a single page app more interactive. Also converted it to a PHP app rather than just HTML.  It's going to be a long page  1/2 

  + Making a PHP page allows me to divide the code into logical files and build the site in sections. The page has now grown and is a lot more organised

  + Also added my notes on the OOP JavaScript Library app.

+ **Technologies Used:** - HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, PHP


### **R2D25:** Wednesday 20th March 2019

### **R2D22:** Friday 15th March 2019

+ **Notes:** - 

  +  Been busy again today. Refined a Slick Carousel Gallery animation for the captions by changing the target.  Still not perfect but now working much better.  
  
  +  Practice with Object Oriented JS went well today.  Able to replicate most of the Class Constructors required for the project, and was close to getting it 100%.   That was the easy bit however but was happy with how it started. 
  
  + Finally, I started a project with the PHP Slick Microframework today. Need more time to look into a problem Currently showing up as "object not found" on my local server but still early days.  :)

### **R2D17:** Friday 8th March 2019

+ **Notes:** - One of the ways I gauge how much I'm actually learning is by returning to topics and refreshing my knowledge.  Going back to Regex today and pleased with how much is making sense.  Oh and I found a great new resource along the way https://regex101.com/ :)
