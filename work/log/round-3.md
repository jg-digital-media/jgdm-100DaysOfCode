## R3D30:  Tuesday 17th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Worked mostly on the client side again today and made what I think are some pretty style features for invalid states.  Tomorrow I start thinking about the server side again. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

## R3D29:  Monday 16th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Got some styling back working on for instant validation feedback using JavaScript. Got to work on fixing up the placement of certain fields before I get to more server side validation. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

## R3D28:  Friday 13th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Got some of my form styles back.  I had wanted to structure the project so all the styles lived in one place but with so many form examples used it wasn't practical. So each form example is now its own mini site with its own styles.  Looking forward to continuing to build on this.  
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

## R3D27:  Thursday 12th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Much better day today.  I now have 3 examples of client side validation and 1 example that seems to be working for Server side form validation. I still have a lot to learn about how to get both ends to work together well. But a productive time. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

## R3D26:  Wednesday 11th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Did something a little different today. I came by SoloLearn.com today and with it learned some useful things about the DOM, JS Form validation and JS Objects. 
+ **Technologies Used** - JavaScript.

## R3D25:  Tuesday 10th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Most of the forms I'm working on are working. But the CSS Styling in the validation is slightly off and finding out why is tricky.  It's down to some CSS rules overriding another - a drawback of building the project the way I am.  #100DaysOfCode.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

## R3D24:  Monday 9th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Spend my #100DaysOfCode time today compartmentalising forms and form styling in the hope it'll make this rather large project easier to organise. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

## R3D23:  Friday 6th September 2019
+ **Notes** - One of those days today.  Just time for a session of coding in Python - refresher on lists and mutability. 
+ **Technologies Used** - Python

## R3D22:  Thursday 5th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Form processing and handling is hard and I'm finding it tough but this is why I'm putting these hours in now. I've started on new technique in a new script and will see how this goes.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, PHP

## R3D21:  Wednesday 4th September 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Making progress every day with my Form Project.  My main win was writing my script to react differently depending on what or if any values are submitted to my forms.  
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, PHP

## R3D20:  Tuesday 3rd September 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Wrote a form that validates Email, website and otherwise text inputs on Server side. Main question: I'm researching if it is possible in PHP to prevention submission of form if validation fails.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

## R3D19:  Monday 2nd September 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Back in action after a short break! I've done some work organising my web forms project. The annoying thing was I lost some of my local databases as I had to reinstall my local server. All set now though.  The Python script I mentioned on Day 18 is also progressing.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

## R3D18:  Friday 23rd August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Time to get back into some other projects today.  It's time I did some proper practice and research into server side form validation.  I have many projects that could benefit from this.
  + Elsewhere I got started on a command line Python App that serves as an interface for a ticket purchase app.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

### **R3D17:** Thursday 22nd August 2019

  + I can announce my latest website is live as of a few minutes ago. For Route Office Supplies Ltd.  I've been working hard on this for the past few weeks and I have a very happy client. Built in SASS, HTML5 with a dash of embedded JS.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5

### **R3D16:** Wednesday 21st August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + I'm Cricket mad this summer.  I wrote a small script in Python in about 10 minutes that calculates the batting run rate based on inputs of total runs and overs used.
+ **Technologies Used** - Python

### **R3D15:** Tuesday 20th August 2019
+ **Notes** -

### **R3D12:** Thursday 15th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Really pleased to have coded the layout in both Grid and standard layout.  Grid works better but I'll certainly be reviewing browser support before releasing that version. Now to build the rest of the site!
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5 

### **R3D11:** Wednesday 14th August 2019

+ **Notes** -

### **R3D10:** Tuesday 13th August 2019

  + Styled the homepage and well on the with the style framework for rest of the pages. Keen to get this going then do a Grid Layout version to compare as I mentioned yesterday. Good Progress!  :)
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5 

### **R3D9:** Monday 12th August 2019

+ **Notes** - 
  + Started the styling for the next web project. Lots of gruelling testing and trial and error but the fundamentals of the layout seem to be in place.  I am considering just going ahead and using CSS Grid.  Support may not be 100% but it might be easier to put together  :)
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5  

### **R3D8:** Friday 9th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Swamped with admin today. But I did have a problem today with some jQuery form validation on a PHP page that simply isn't kicking in.  Unable to determine why yet but it's on my ToDo list.  :)
+  **Technologies Used** - Sass, jQuery, Python

### **R3D7:** Thursday 8th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Finally got into some coding for Python exceptions in the last couple of days; the difference between catching and raising.  Elsewhere my day has been about exporting and testing dozens of video drafts.

### **R3D5:** Tuesday 6th August 2019

+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass

### **R3D4:** Monday 5th August 2019
+ **Notes** -

  + Managed to fit in some time for Python coding too. 
  
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Python

### **R3D3:** Friday 2nd August 2019 
+ **Notes** - 
  + Most of my coding day involved doing some behind the scenes editing in WordPress.  Itching to show you the full website but that is at my clients behest!  We're content building!
  + Managed to find some time, after Wireframing for another web project to do some Python coding too. Busy day!  :-)
+ **Technologies Used** - WordPress, Python


### **R3D2:** Thursday 1st August 2019 
+ **Notes** -
  + Just time for a few lines of Python code today. Been doing some Wireframes for an incoming web project today
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass,  HTML5, PHP, Python

### **R3D1:** Wednesday 31st July 2019 
+ **Notes** - 
  + Started a refresher on the Basics of Python.  I know the Syntax but one thing I need to get more comfortable with is catching and raising Exceptions. Got to Catch those errors
  + Caught that error with PHP Authentication. The cookie is now passed correctly into those Web Tokens nice and securely. Think I was trying to decode the JWT as JSON causing it to not be read properly.
  + But now on the server it the entire won't connect properly, Error: 500. Fine on localhost.  One step at a time etc  :)
