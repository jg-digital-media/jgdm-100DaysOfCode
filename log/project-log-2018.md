## *Introduction*

I've rejigged my blog to restart my 100DaysofCode challenge.  The last one was a dud, really. I didn't last a week and even then I think I missed a day.  

I won't last 100 straight days this time either, although I intend to complete 100 Days. My goal is to help myself maintain not just my coding (I can always be found coding) but also an active social media presence.

### **Day 5**: Friday September 14th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continue with the 4 in a row project.
+ **Progress:** Definitely my toughest day yet with the four in a row project.  Trying to interpret instructions and just not doing it properly but once explained, I understood more about what was going on. I got through it! 
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + What makes things even more difficult is when my brain is convinced my code is right when the truth is staring me in the face.

  + Key takeaway from today: Learning that not every constructor method needs parameters especially if values are hard coded into them.

### **Day 4**: Thursday September 13th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**
   + Further work on OOP By Example

   + Practice with brainstorming properties of a clas and their constructor methods.

   + Hopefully soon learn how an Application comes together using JavaScript.

+ **Progress:** Wrote the first couple of constructors for the Classes Player and Token.  But most of my time was spent thinking of my own suggestions for state and behaviour to be applied to them.
   
+ **Thoughts:** Felt like I'd made reasonable suggestions for properties and methods that might go in them but the final solutions were simpler than apparently needed in the end.

### **Day 3**: Wednesday September 12th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continuation of exploration of forEach methods and to start working on an OOP JavaScript project
+ **Progress:** 
  + Great day today working out some problems with using a forEach loop.  I'm hopeful today the forEach syntax is starting to sink in.

  + Also started my first main project of this code challenge.  Making a "four in a row" game. Everything right now feels okay and not unmanageable. Which could change anytime. :)

+ **Thoughts:** 

  + Using the value parameter and the arrow function Syntax when working with the forEach method.

  + I've rediscovered why debugging is my favourite part of programming. Getting rid of mistakes and working out problems can be so rewarding.

  + After having worked with Python for so long this year, I'm having to retrain my brain not to think of Python Syntax when using condition statements in JavaScript.

### **Day 2**: Tuesday September 10th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Finish Object literal basics practice. Make a start with forEach iteration methods.
+ **Progress:** Finished object literal practice
+ **Thoughts:** 
 
  + Point worth noting, I'm assigning the value of a string property of one object to a new property of the same object
  + Remembering that updating a property the same syntax as adding a new property on the fly.

### **Day 1**: Monday September 10th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** To refresh my knowledge of declaring basic JavaScript objects before moving onto applying the basics to a working example.
+ **Progress:** Good working session with some refreshers on adding different types of properties on an object and how to call them.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + There's always more than one way to work out a programming problem but the key takeaway here is that the easiest way isn't always the best way.
  + One of the reasons I think I struggle so much is because I can overcomplicate things in my mind.
  + It is okay and even recommended to rely on documentation when you needed. You don't need to work it all out yourself.
