### **R3D15:** Tuesday 20th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + I can announce my latest website is live as of a few minutes ago. For Route Office Supplies Ltd.  I've been working hard on this for the past few weeks and I have a very happy client. Built in SASS, HTML5 with a dash of embedded JS. 
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

### **R3D14:** Monday 19th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Website now starting to take shape. I hope by tomorrow to present it for first evaluation to my client!

### **R3D13:** Friday 16th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Approaching the final stages of the website.  Adding transitions, responsive images and a google map to the site.  Hoping to finish the project by the end of the next week.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5 

### **R3D12:** Thursday 15th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Really pleased to have coded the layout in both Grid and standard layout.  Grid works better but I'll certainly be reviewing browser support before releasing that version. Now to build the rest of the site!

### **R3D11:** Wednesday 14th August 2019

+ **Notes** - 
  + Got the responsive layout for the website sorted.

### **R3D10:** Tuesday 13th August 2019

+ **Notes** - 
  + Styled the homepage and well on the with the style framework for rest of the pages. Keen to get this going then do a Grid Layout version to compare as I mentioned yesterday. Good Progress!  :)

### **R3D9:** Monday 12th August 2019

+ **Notes** - 
  + Started the styling for the next web project. Lots of gruelling testing and trial and error but the fundamentals of the layout seem to be in place.  I am considering just going ahead and using CSS Grid.  Support may not be 100% but it might be easier to put together  :)
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5  

### **R3D8:** Friday 9th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Swamped with admin today. But I did have a problem today with some jQuery form validation on a PHP page that simply isn't kicking in.  Unable to determine why yet but it's on my ToDo list.  :)
+  **Technologies Used** - Sass, jQuery, Python

### **R3D7:** Thursday 8th August 2019
+ **Notes** -

### **R3D1:** Wednesday 31st July 2019 
+ **Notes** - 
  + Started a refresher on the Basics of Python.  I know the Syntax but one thing I need to get more comfortable with is catching and raising Exceptions. Got to Catch those errors
  + Caught that error with PHP Authentication. The cookie is now passed correctly into those Web Tokens nice and securely. Think I was trying to decode the JWT as JSON causing it to not be read properly.
