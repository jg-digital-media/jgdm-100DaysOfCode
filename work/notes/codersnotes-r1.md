+ **POMPT** use scrollStory to animate the nav element with the class of  mainnav-container so that the highlighted anchor element changes according to the scroll position


+ **POMPT** I'm struggling to get the active link class to appear on the navigation links. Any ideas as to why they're not showing up?



+ **POMPT** Finally, it's no good if the navigation menu isnt visible at all times is it?  Please put a sticky/fixed property on the nav element so we can see the effect as we scroll
