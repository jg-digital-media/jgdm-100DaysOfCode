### **R2D65:** Monday 3rd June 2019

  + Password hashing today. Finally understood today what it is to put it into practice.  There may be an issue though with whether the correct data is being stored in the database.

+ **Technologies Used** - PHP

### **R2D64:** Tuesday 28th May 2019

+ **Technologies Used** - PHP, json

+ **Notes**
  + Proud of my progress today. Learning Postman to manage API requests, reading error messages, solving them, seeing the changes made to the database in JSON. Rewarding
  + The reason the review data wasn't showing, up by the way, was because I forgot to add the constructor for the Review class. Sometimes you need a break to see these things

### **R2D60:** Tuesday 21st May 2019

  + I would highly recommend you try this if you are in any way interested in digital music creation or performance.  I wrote about this here in my blog. 
+ **Technologies Used** - Ruby - Sonic Pi

### **R2D34:** Tuesday 2nd April 2019

+ **Technologies Used** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

### **R2D31:** Thursday 28th March 2019

### **R2D30:** Wednesday 27th March 2019

+ **Notes** 

  + Main business of the day... I've spent a lot of time trying to delve into the mvc-framework project. Learned how to add routes in PHP and link the correct content to them.

  + It hasn't gone 100% according to plan though. The post route for the form should be logging an email to a file and redirecting to the thank you page. It isn't.

  + Added some more Regex practice to the repository.  Including boilerplates for the rest of the sections of the page. Should make building the rest of this less labourious :)
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

### **R2D29:** Tuesday 26th March 2019

+ **Technologies Used:** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
### **R2D26:** Thursday 21st March 2019

+ **Notes:** - 
  +  Added some jQuery that makes the Regex Practice page, a single page app more interactive. Also converted it to a PHP app rather than just HTML.  It's going to be a long page  1/2 

  + Making a PHP page allows me to divide the code into logical files and build the site in sections. The page has now grown and is a lot more organised

+ **Technologies Used:** - HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, PHP

  +  Practice with Object Oriented JS went well today.  Able to replicate most of the Class Constructors required for the project, and was close to getting it 100%.   That was the easy bit however but was happy with how it started. 
  
  + Finally, I started a project with the PHP Slick Microframework today. Need more time to look into a problem Currently showing up as "object not found" on my local server but still early days.  :)


+ **Technologies Used:** - HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP

### **R2D21:** Thursday 14th March 2019

### **R2D17:** Friday 8th March 2019

+ **Technologies Used:** - HTML5, Regex

### **R2D16:** Thursday 7th March 2019
