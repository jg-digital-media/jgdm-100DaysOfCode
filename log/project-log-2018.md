## *Introduction*

I've rejigged my blog to restart my 100DaysofCode challenge.  The last one was a dud, really. I didn't last a week and even then I think I missed a day.  

I won't like 100 straight days this time. My goal is to help myself maintain not just my coding (I can always be found coding) but also an active social media precense.
