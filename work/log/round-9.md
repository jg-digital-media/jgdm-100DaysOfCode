+ I've got some styling in place for Shop and Product pages. Although I did notice at the moment that Search page currently isn't functioning/visible at all so there's that to look at next.  Big build.

+ Good progress made today through WordPress. Finished off a few Post types.  I've created several more but stylistically it needs more work to get right.  Day off tomorrow.
