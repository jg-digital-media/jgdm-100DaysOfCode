           <h2> <a href="pages/my-history.html" target="blank">A History</a></h2>

           <p>I was born in July 1983. Born in the 80's but a child of the 90's and now totally bedded into the technology age.  I was statemented as a child of special education needs not long after I was born and ever since I have been doing my best to muddle through this thing that we call life.</p>

           <p>I was written off as a child who would never make it through the mainstream education system. Before I left however I proudly passed every GCSE I took, even if it wasn't the highs of the A's and the A stars. I have been battling the odds ever since.</p>

           <p>Some people like to make plans for their lives in increments of 5 years! I prefer to take it one day at a time and see if I make it through. In the meantime I like to pretend I understand stuff on social media and make web pages for clients.</p>

           <h2> Dyspraxia </h2>

           <p>A big part of what has shaped the person that I am is my Dyspraxia.</p>

           <p>Dyspraxia is a specific learning difficulty. What causes it, is not known but it is disruption of the brain chat causes chemical messages that tell the brain how to control the body to not fully transmitted. This can cause problems with movement, speech and language, memory and thought.  Some times I wish it wasn't there and I could be like neurotypical people. But, it is what it is and Dyspraxia makes me what I am.

           <p>The <a href="https://www.dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk" target="blank">Dyspraxia Foundation</a> has more information and links to resources about it.</p> 

           <p>For more information you can also read the website I made for <a href="https://dyspraxia.jonniegrieve.co.uk">myself about raising awareness of Dyspraxia</a>. </p>
