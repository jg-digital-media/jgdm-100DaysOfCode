### **R3D3:** Friday 2nd August 2019 
+ **Notes** - 
  + Most of my coding day involved doing some behind the scenes editing in WordPress.  Itching to show you the full website but that is at my clients behest!  We're content building!
  + Managed to find some time, after Wireframing for another web project to do some Python coding too. Busy day!  :-)
+ **Technologies Used** - WordPress, Python


### **R3D2:** Thursday 1st August 2019 
+ **Notes** -
  + Just time for a few lines of Python code today. Been doing some Wireframes for an incoming web project today
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass,  HTML5, PHP, Python

### **R3D1:** Wednesday 31st July 2019 
+ **Notes** - 
  + Started a refresher on the Basics of Python.  I know the Syntax but one thing I need to get more comfortable with is catching and raising Exceptions. Got to Catch those errors
  + Caught that error with PHP Authentication. The cookie is now passed correctly into those Web Tokens nice and securely. Think I was trying to decode the JWT as JSON causing it to not be read properly.
  + But now on the server it the entire won't connect properly, Error: 500. Fine on localhost.  One step at a time etc  :)
