## Day 3 - 

Filling in some projects and their completed status into the Vue.js page I made.  More to get done tomorrow. Looking forward to finding a way to integrate this into one of my websites  :)

I got stuck for a few minutes when for Vue couldn't find one of the properties for some reason.  I thought I'd reached some sort of limit of instances to display. Turned out I'd left a stray comma between one of the objects in my array so of course Vue was looking for an extra object that didn't exist. Easily fixed. 


```javascript

//TYPERROR: 
vue.js:634 [Vue warn]: Error in render: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'status' of undefined"

(found in <Root>)

```

## Day 2

This is just some of the expressions I've been trying to render the correct classes in the vue instance  ```javascript/vue/vue-status-project/scripts/app.js```

```html

        <span v-bind:class="{'complete': projects[true], 'incomplete': !projects[false]}">{{ status.project_status }} </span>
        <span v-bind:class="{'complete': projects.status, 'incomplete': !projects.status}">{{ status.project_status }} </span>

```

I want to understand why only all green and all red background styles are showing up but no matching to the JS Object.

With some help... and it's okay to accept help in order to learn...  I've finally cracked it.  

<span v-bind:class="{'complete': projects[true], 'incomplete': !projects[false]}">

<span v-bind:class="{'complete': status, 'incomplete': !status}">

<span v-bind:class="{'complete': status.status, 'incomplete': !status.status}">  #### This one

In order to correctly render the HTML classes, I needed to reference the ```status``` tracking variable in ```v-for``` as well as the status property of the vue instance.

```html
 <ul id="project-status">
    <li v-for="status in projects">
        <span v-bind:class="{'complete': status.status, 'incomplete': !status.status}">{{ status.project_status }} </span>
    </li>
</ul>
```


## Day 1

To kick off Round 2

+ Refresher on creating Semantic HTML
+ Python Practice  (Functions + Handling Input and Output)
+ CSS Selectors for JavaScript
+ JavaScript Object Interaction
+ PHP
+ Java Practice (Lists, Generics, Maps and Interfaces)

### Vue

Adding Project data as a property of the data object rather than its own array of object separate from the view instance.  This allowed me to display the data.

The next part is about displaying a style based on whether a property of the projects object is true or false. 

```v-if="name.projectName=!false"```
