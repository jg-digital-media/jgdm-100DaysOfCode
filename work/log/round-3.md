+ **Notes** - 
  + Started a refresher on the Basics of Python.  I know the Syntax but one thing I need to get more comfortable with is catching and raising Exceptions. Got to Catch those errors
  + Caught that error with PHP Authentication. The cookie is now passed correctly into those Web Tokens nice and securely. Think I was trying to decode the JWT as JSON causing it to not be read properly.
  + But now on the server it the entire won't connect properly, Error: 500. Fine on localhost.  One step at a time etc  :)
