### Python Basics - Covering Strings and basic String methods

```python

# \ escaping  

# use an escape sequence  - treat things as a string

# \

# \n  - new line

#""" triple quotes

#Concatenation - combine strings to return a new string

#Strings are immutable. They cannot be changed after they are created

#dessert = "chocolate" + " and marshmallows"
#dessert = dessert + " and graham crackers"
#dessert += ", yum"


#String methods

#A method - a function owned by an object.

#quotes = "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new"
#len(quote) - get the length of a string

#quote.len()
#quote.upper()  - call the upper method on a string. does not return original string. a new string
#quote.lower() -  call the upper method on a string.
#quote.title() - title

#String formatting

#subject_template = "Thanks for learning {} with us {}!"
#subject_template.format("Python", "Craig")
#"Thanks for learning 

#"Welcome to Treehouse {} {}".format("Mr", "Grieve")

#Check one string is contained in another

#"Tree" in "Treehouse"

#"Jon" in "Grieve
```
