    <h1>About this App</h1>

    <p>Development for this app begun on the 10th February 2024.</p>
    
    <p>It has been a brainchild of mine for many years. It was an idea I came up with during, ironically a Web Accessibility module for web design at University.</p> 

    <p>However I knew I didn't have the &quot;spoons&quot; to create it on my own. I don't say that to do myself down. When I say I don't have the &quot;spoons&quot; I mean that I don't have the knowledge or skills; the power or the patience in my head to sit down to be able to create it when I think about the enormity, time and effort it would take.</p>

    <p>Then the age of AI came. I say that as if I'm thinking about it lightly, but I don't. ....</p>
