### R4D03:  Tuesday 14th January 2020
+ **Notes** - 
  + Busy one today! Quick Thread. Had the pleasure of looking into a great framework I found via CSS-Tricks - Greensock for Web animation.  Lots to explore there.
  + Looked into the Twilio API and managed to use it to send a text message to my phone via the Web console and my Git Bash Terminal.  Using the PostMan app was a step too far but tomorrow's another day!
  + Used node.js to set up 2 Node Routes with one static data, one that uses a variable.  This will later be used to populate with data from the Treehouse API.  Basically like I tried before Christmas  (and I still want to host it somewhere!)

+ **Technologies used** - API, JavaScript, Node.js

### R4D02:  Monday 13th January 2020
+ **Notes** - 
  + Made a start exploring an example of an API... the Spotify API using Craig Dennis's course via YouTube.  Then went on to make sure I have a localhost server running via Node.js

+ **Technologies used** - API, JavaScript, Node.js
