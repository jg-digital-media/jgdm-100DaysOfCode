            <h2> A History </h2>

            <article>

                <p>I was born in July 1983. Born in the 80's but a child of the 90's and now totally bedded into the technology age.  I was statemented as a child of special education needs not long after I was born and ever since I have been doing my best to muddle through this thing that we call life. The way I think and perceive the world is different to the average person.</p>

                <p>I was written off as a child who would never make it through the mainstream education system. Before I left however I proudly passed every GCSE I took, even if it wasn't the highs of the A's and the A stars. I have been battling the odds ever since.</p>

                <p>Some people like to make plans for their lives in increments of 5 years! I prefer to take it one day at a time and see if I make it through. In the meantime I like to pretend I understand stuff on social media and make web pages for clients.</p>

                <p>A big part of what has shaped the person that I am is my Dyspraxia.</p>

                <p>Dyspraxia is a specific learning difficulty. What causes it, is not known but it is disruption of the brain chat causes chemical messages that tell the brain how to control the body to not fully transmitted. This can cause problems with movement, speech and language, memory and thought.  Some times I wish it wasn't there and I could be like neurotypical people. But, it is what it is and Dyspraxia makes me what I am. </p>

                <p>In my life I've never really been an "outdoorsy" person and that will always be there in my psyche. But about a month or so before Covid-19 affected the country, a seed was planted in my brain.</p>

            <h2>Christianity</h2>

            <article>

                <p>I was raised to be a Christian. This is not always okay for people, for instance those who believe people should not be indoctrinated. But the fact remains all our lives and our beliefs are shaped by our experiences. We all get our worldview from somewhere.</p>

                <p>So why then do I continue to believe into adulthood? My faith isn't based on something tangible. Few of us can call on something we might call a Damascus road moment. While others live their lives front and centre on God, mine is more reserved. I don't know that God exists and therefore I don't act like it. But what I <em>do</em> believe is that while none of us are born believing in God, we are born with a kind of inbuilt connection to a creator.</p>

                <p>How that manifests itself I don't know. But that's okay. Faith is not in some kind of race with science and reason. It's a very personal thing. I do think however this "connection" I spoke about fills our lives spiritually in a way that nothing else in the world can. Not family; not money; not wealth; not jobs, or our favourite football team.</p>

                <p>At the same time I find myself very much in touch with both secular and Christian thinking. What I'm trying to say is I am faithful but not very religious. The truth is I've never been minded to turn away from it because it is all I've known. I don't believe the Christian faith (or any peaceful faith for that matter) is something to run away from.</p>

            <h2>Politics </h2>

            <h2>Politics</h2>

            <article>

                <p> As I write this, I am a card carrying member of the UK Labour Party. Politics is not pretty. I often find myself in awe of people who go into it because I assume that most people if not all go into the "game" to make life better for the people they represent. But it's ugly because it is adversarial. To win the game you have to denigrate your opponent and spin things to make yourself look better and hope the numbers come good for you when it comes to an election. </p>

                <p>As I said, I like to assume than when people choose to become councilors, or MP's they do so with a genuine sense of duty. But I find that hard to believe about some members of the UK Conservative Party. If making like better is the aim let's just say I find their policies and ideology counter intuitive.</p>

                <p>In Politics there are certain things you have to accept. Like the results of elections. We are living in a world now where in otherwise strong and stable countries like America, upon which you should look to as a bastian of the democratic process, can be very near ripped apart because of claims of election changing fraud. Such claims being made without evidence but are made and believed. We're living in a world now where delusion and self interest in politics is key part of the game and I'm not sure that is a box that can be put back.</p>

                <p>That is all a big reason why I've taken a greater interest in politics in recent years. As a Dyspraxic person I wonder how these people cram their vocation and personal lives into their brains. But I salute them, (most of them at least), and I'm not short of my opinions about them and the political process.  </p>
