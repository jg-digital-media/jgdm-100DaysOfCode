### R3D87:  Thursday 12th December 2019

+ **Notes** - Added a new route to the simple node site I'm making but I still don't know how to make the pages recognise the routes correctly. Struggling and still have a lot to learn.

+ **Technologies used** - CSS, HTML5, Node.js


### R3D86:  Wednesday 11th December 2019

+ **Notes** - Rendered some HTML via Node Routes to 2 routes today.  Bit of progress but right now it's only 1 route seems to be working with the rest being conflicted with another. So next, it's sorting that and binding more values and templates.

+ **Technologies used** - SASS, HTML5, Node.js

### R3D85:  Tuesday 10th December 2019

+ **Notes** - Wrote a script in node that handles multiple routes.  They don't do anything too exciting yet but that's to come.   :)

+ **Technologies used** - SASS, HTML5, Node.js

### R3D84:  Monday 9th December 2019

+ **Notes** - Made some progress rewriting a large CSS codebase into Sass... more than I made on Friday.  Then later on with node I successfully created a local web server and learned some things about killing node processes on the command line  :)

+ **Technologies used** - SASS, HTML5, Node.js

### R3D83:  Friday 6th December 2019

+ **Notes** - Made a request to a Weather Data API with nodeJS and data is being retrieved. Now to work out how to filter and get back the data the way I want it. Currently it's only for ZIP codes but I can work on that.  :)

+ **Technologies used** - VueJS, CSS, HTML5, Node.js

### R3D82:  Thursday 5th December 2019
+ **Notes** - Working with VueJS and later on with Node.  I feel like I have a better understanding on Stream events and how to use them in Node requests.
+ **Technologies used** - VueJS, CSS, HTML5, Node.js

### R3D81:  Wednesday 4th December 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Learned to parse a string as JSON in node.js using the responses on method. Got some things working but the why's are still a bit of a mystery right now. What's the difference between "data" and "end" on on() events for example? 
+ **Technologies used** - PHP, CSS, HTML5, Node.js

### R3D80:  Tuesday 3rd December 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Presented my form update to my client and will be putting that live tomorrow.  Looking forward to making some behind the scenes changes to the CSS too.  
  + Also delved into a little bit of node.js worked on the bones of making a simple HTTPS get request. The aim being to learn to make a website powered by node just as I've tried with Slim via PHP.
+ **Technologies used** - PHP, CSS, HTML5, Node.js

### R3D79:  Monday 2nd December 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + After a week off due to illness I got back to what I was working on for my client, Auto Cleanse North East. Thrilled to get to the bottom of the issue that was causing the PHP form handler to fail. 
  + An issue with the conditional statement checking the submission of the form as a whole rather than the value of the specific form submit button.
+ **Technologies used** - PHP, CSS, HTML5

### R3D78:  Friday 22nd November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  +  Spending today working on some behind the scenes changes to web form on Auto Cleanse North East Website.  The code as a whole needs a behind the scenes refit which I'm looking forward to implementing. The Form handling code I've written hasn't worked though. Have to troubleshoot why.
+ **Technologies used** - PHP, CSS, HTML5

### R3D77:  Thursday 21st November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  +  Focused on persisting data in VueJS Applications again with localStorage. App now adds new items, and persists them but does not persist deletes. Yet. What are Computed properties again?  Will be working on that next.  :)
+ **Technologies used** - PHP, Sass, HTML5

### R3D76:  Wednesday 20th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  +  Just launched my latest website project https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/php_website The purpose of which is to practice and develop my PHP Skills.  It also uses jQuery and the JavaScript LazyLoad library. Planning to add more dynamic elements to it in due course!
+ **Technologies used** - PHP, Sass, HTML5

### R3D75:  Tuesday 19th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  +  Added a new section to Form Project over at https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/form_project and made some minor updates to the PHP based website I've been working on, removing more of the dummy content. Almost there!  :)
+ **Technologies used** - PHP

### R3D74:  Monday 18th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Continued with PHP website example to implement document jumps in the inventory submenu and improved the styling for the sub menu itself.
  + Updated the form project to include details about using security best practices for working with GET and POST methods for sending data. https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/form_project
  + Another Vue App for my Vue Project which is a Simple voting application. This one WILL provide a means to practice using localStorage to persist data.
+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, SASS/CSS, PHP

### R3D73:  Friday 15th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Implemented LazyLoad on a web project I'm working on, and elsewhere worked on a new "Form Project" section that deals specifically with $_GET superglobals.
+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, SASS/CSS, jQuery, VueJS

### R3D72:  Thursday 14th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Implemented PHP code to remove  navigation items depending on the value of a string variable. Extremely useful for serving only the web content that is needed.
  + This means the website is nearer now to completion but still need to work out the best styling for when the sub menu is needed.
  + I've changed plan on this slightly as I was intending to Jump through portions of the menu using a drop down box but when researching found this considered to be bad practice. So I made a jQuery toggle menu instead.
  + I haven't built it to production yet but finally completed the VueJS app. It handles data from a REST API but not local storage. I'll try one more Vue Project that does this before I move on from Vue.
+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, SASS/CSS, jQuery, VueJS

### R3D71:  Wednesday 13th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Worked mostly in Sass and HTML5 today. Uploaded a landing page for an advertising campaign I want to use it for and worked on markup and styling for my PHP based project.
+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, SASS/CSS, PHP

### R3D70:  Tuesday 12th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Worked mostly in Sass and HTML5 today. But I spent most of my time working out a runtime bug in VueJS which in the end turned out to be misplaced method in a Vue Component! 
+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, SASS/CSS, VueJS

### R3D69:  Monday 11th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Much more confident in using the VS Code debugger now.  Will keep working on that to make sure it sticks. Started a new Carousel project to serve as a landing page for Google Ads.
+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, SASS/CSS

### R3D68:  Friday 8th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Started building the header styling for the php website I'm building. Will be using array data initially to build the main dynamic content. Initially. Have studied examples of array syntax to get grounding on how this can be done.  
  + Also spent a little time looking into how the Visual Code Debugger works.
+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, SASS/CSS, PHP

### R3D67:  Thursday 7th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Finished the timed Maths quiz app in Python. Looking forward to attempting on expanding that. Added the markup for a new PHP Website and the VueApp now has basic form validation added.  Productive day! 
+ **Technologies used** - Python, HTML5, Vue.js

### R3D66:  Wednesday 6th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Added read and addition functionality (CRUD) in the latest VueJS app, some functionality to the python timed math quiz CLI and did a mockup wireframe for a new PHP website. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, CSS, Vue.js, Python

### R3D65:  Tuesday 5th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + The main takeaway from today is that I explored using Vue Create App CLI to make VueJS Projects. I had intended to do my next VueJS expample without it but the pull was too great.  :) Need to get comfortable with Component Syntax 

* **Technologies Used** - HTML5, CSS, Vue.js, Python

### R3D64:  Monday 4th November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Python Dates and Times, more attempts at VueJS Lazyloading and some prep for future projects.  In particular making space for another Vue Basics tutorial. Oh yes, and I've replaced some images reducing the pageload on my website. 

* **Technologies Used** - HTML5, CSS, Vue.js, Python


### R3D63:  Friday 1st November 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Finished off the card game utility class example in Python, the responsive styling for the Vue.js todo app example and tidied up that directory a little bit in preparation for more examples to go there. 
  + Also started studying some code of Dates and Times in Python

* **Technologies Used** - HTML5, CSS, Vue.js, Python

### R3D62:  Thursday 31st October 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Worked on cleaning up some redundant and/or unused styles in my website.  In Python I worked on a dice roller utility using OOP programming.

* **Technologies Used** - CSS, Python

### R3D61:  Wednesday 30th October 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Converted the social media icons on my website to a single SVG Sprite map. This has reduced HTTP requests by 5.  I can reduce bandwitdh even further by replacing PNG's with JPEGs for most images. will do that next.
  + Lazy loading hasn't worked out yet. I'm having trouble trying to make it worth with NPM but I'm sure there are other ways to make it worth but it doesn't like Vue.js very much at all.  :)

* **Technologies Used** - Vue.js

### R3D60:  Tuesday 29th October 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Wanted to create some interactivity to my Vue App by changing the status of a project both visually and syncing with the data via local storage. This has proved tricky. But it remains on my todo list.
  + Learned some interesting things about front end performance optimisation that I am looking forward to putting in practice. I did a performance check. Speed ratings are very good but could be even better.
  + I see my site currently downloads 2mb of resources in less than 2 seconds over 38 HTTP Requests. This is something I'm looking forward to fixing.

* **Technologies Used** - Vue.js

### R3D59:  Monday 28th October 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Bound more data using vue directives and updated the appropriate project images.  Once I did that I spent some time looking at best practices for performance optimisation.

* **Technologies Used** - Vue.js

### R3D58:  Friday 25th October 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Good progress today. I managed to edit my data, bind file paths to an image attribute to load images dynamically.  What I'd like to do now is add clickable images and the ability to change the complete/incomplete project data via localStorage.

* **Technologies Used** - Vue.js

### R3D57:  Thursday 24th October 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Started on the placeholder content for the new project status list.  But it's a mess in terms of how I've coded it as I've adapted it from the previous version. This could take some time but I'll try to look at that next.  :)
+ **Technologies Used** - Vue.js


### R3D56:  Wednesday 23rd October 2019
+ **Notes** -

  + Today hasn't gone as well as I hoped on Vue.js but I was able to create persistent date using localStorage so that was useful. Think tomorrow I'm just going to press on and build by project image viewer. I know enough now I think with what I've learned. :) 

+ **Technologies Used** - Vue.js

### R3D55:  Tuesday 22nd October 2019
+ **Notes** -

  + Have made a number of commits today.  As it happens the tutorial I started today is incomplete so not everything has been done.  But I think this time has served its purpose.

  + I have wired up a number of CRUD operations with Vue.  I've refreshed myself on a number of Vue concepts. I only have one more thing I want to explore which is using Local Storage with Vue.

+ **Technologies Used** - Vue.js

### R3D54:  Monday 21st October 2019
+ **Notes** - Started a new project today with Vue.js.  One of my goals with #100DaysOfCode this year was to make a project image viewer dynamically with the Vue.js technology.  I found this tutorial to help refresh me and maybe give me some pointers along the way.  :)
+ **Technologies Used** - Python, Vue.js

### R3D53:  Friday 18th October 2019
+ **Notes** - additional maths operations with magic methods
+ **Technologies Used** - Python 

### R3D52:  Thursday 17th October 2019
+ **Notes** - url focus animation  fade in on focus
+ **Technologies Used** - CSS, HTML5 

### R3D51:  Wednesday 16th October 2019
+ **Notes** - Explored how to make multiple classes work together in a set of Python scripts.
+ **Technologies Used** - Python


### R3D50:  Tuesday 15th October 2019
+ **Notes** - The updates I talked about yesterday are now live and can be viewed here at https://kevinmangles-magician.com/  It's great to be able to use my skills to enhance the work I do for my clients!
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP, Python

### R3D49:  Monday 14th October 2019
+ **Notes** - Spent most of today starting on some important updates to the front end for a client. Hopefully this will be finished by tomorrow.  :)  Found some time for Python OOP inheritance practice too.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP, Python

### R3D48:  Friday 11th October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

   + Some updates to my website are now live.  Includes additions to form validation on both the client and server side which means several layers of form validation are now in place.  My website is available as always by logging on to jonniegrieve.co.uk 
   + I'd still like to do further updates to the validation by checking for correct URL's and email addresses via the main form
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

### R3D47:  Thursday 10th October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

   + Client side validation and server side now working in unison. Used jquery to dismiss individual error messages generated by PHP. It requires JS to be switched on but it's a much better user experience
   + Used python to code a simple class as I try once again to get to terms with OOP. Understood the use of \__*dunder*__ methods including \__main\__ and "\__init\__"
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

### R3D46:  Wednesday 9th October 2019
+ **Notes** - Got some simple server side validation sorted on my website now.  2 versions of the form loaded until I can find a better solution, but users will find their forms are saved so they don't have to fill in everything again.  Will be uploaded to server soon!
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

### R3D45:  Tuesday 8th October 2019
+ **Notes** - Took a little while but I've got the basis of some server side validation scripting for the web form on my website. From memory. Got a plan together now for completing the rest. But how to make it a good user experience?
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

### R3D44:  Monday 7th October 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Following on from my form project work I've applied more client side validation to the main form on my website.  Server side will be next up.
  + It was hard to tell if it worked initially however as it seems HTML5 Validation takes priority.  So I removed that for now.  I'll be sure to add that later.
  + 2 more versions of the masterticket python script added today and went on furter to study Python Dictionary syntax..
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

### R3D43:  Friday 4th October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  +  Finished my look into Python sequences, learned the concept of Membership Testing and Concatenation. Next up, Python Dictionaries.
+ **Technologies Used** - Python

### R3D42:  Thursday 3rd October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  +  "Form Project" is live! This is a collection of pages and web forms of various types. https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/form_project/  I wrote a blog about what this project is all about which you can find here!  #100DaysOfCode
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

### R3D41:  Wednesday 2nd October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  + Finally launching "Form Project" tomorrow. Had intended to do it today but had matters elsewhere to attend to. Just been doing some last minute checks which will continue into tomorrow. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

### R3D40:  Tuesday 1st October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  +  Writing a blog to discuss the "Form Project" I've been working on... what I've been doing, why I've been doing it, what I've learned. why it's been worth doing. So that's most of the #100DaysOfCode I've been doing today.  Also learned a bit more about Python Sequences.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

### R3D39:  Monday 30th September 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  + Coded the styling of error messages on forms today.  Hoping to show you all what I've been working on very soon
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

### R3D38:  Friday 27th September 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  + Big update today. I've found a solution to organise common stylesheets to one directory so I can update the main styles in one place with individual stylesheets in their own place. 
  + I'll still need to run sass --watch commands in several locations to update the different content but it's a good solution. 
  + Where yesterday I learned about Packing in Python today I learned the opposite pattern in unpacking.

+ **Technologies** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

### R3D37:  Thursday 26th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Another round of bug fixes on my form project work.  Felt like I'd gained more understanding of what it is to process good web forms today but still a lot more work to come.  With Python I learned about "packing" arguments in functions.
+ **Technologies** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

### R3D36:  Wednesday 25th September 2019
+ **Notes** - More work on my big "Form project" today. And some practice on returning Python values in functions. Much like Yesterday. I've been going through a round of bugs and inconconsitencies in the code.
+ **Technologies** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

### R3D35:  Tuesday 24th September 2019
+ **Notes** - More work on my big "Form project" today. And some practice on returning Python values in functions.  I think the lightbulb has finally switched on about what returning values actually means.  I've always understood it syntactically but not what it means.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

### R3D34:  Monday 23rd September 2019
+ **Notes** - I've finally written a suitable form handling script that validates form data OR sends an email. Worked a lot of hours and looked at a lot of tutorials to do it but it's paying off. Looking forward to sharing.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

### R3D33:  Friday 20th September 2019
+ **Notes** - I'm at a loss for this one. There must be a subtle difference in PHP versions causing different behaviour in localhost and online. Why is the redirect not working on successful form submission?
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

### R3D32:  Thursday 19th September 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  + Started a script courtesy of The Art of The Web Tutorials that unless I'm mistaken should pause submission of an email form depending on existence of validation errors. https://www.the-art-of-web.com/php/form-handler/ 
  + Still needs some work. I'm not getting emails returned regardlessThat effort goes on.  :)  Python wise I learned some interesting things about Tuples I wasn't aware of before.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python.

### R3D31:  Wednesday 18th September 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + New example of a server side validated form is up.  It tells us when there are fields that still need filling in and identifies which fields are missing.  Will be working on refining this tomorrow with better styling. https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/form_project/w3schools/index.php 
  + In Python I was able to code a nice command line Shopping List App on pretty much the first go. Am pleased with what I was able to run on my own when prompted 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python.

### R3D30:  Tuesday 17th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Worked mostly on the client side again today and made what I think are some pretty style features for invalid states.  Tomorrow I start thinking about the server side again. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

### R3D29:  Monday 16th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Got some styling back working on for instant validation feedback using JavaScript. Got to work on fixing up the placement of certain fields before I get to more server side validation. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

### R3D28:  Friday 13th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Got some of my form styles back.  I had wanted to structure the project so all the styles lived in one place but with so many form examples used it wasn't practical. So each form example is now its own mini site with its own styles.  Looking forward to continuing to build on this.  
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

### R3D27:  Thursday 12th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Much better day today.  I now have 3 examples of client side validation and 1 example that seems to be working for Server side form validation. I still have a lot to learn about how to get both ends to work together well. But a productive time. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

### R3D26:  Wednesday 11th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Did something a little different today. I came by SoloLearn.com today and with it learned some useful things about the DOM, JS Form validation and JS Objects. 
+ **Technologies Used** - JavaScript.

### R3D25:  Tuesday 10th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Most of the forms I'm working on are working. But the CSS Styling in the validation is slightly off and finding out why is tricky.  It's down to some CSS rules overriding another - a drawback of building the project the way I am.  #100DaysOfCode.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

### R3D24:  Monday 9th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Spend my #100DaysOfCode time today compartmentalising forms and form styling in the hope it'll make this rather large project easier to organise. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

### R3D23:  Friday 6th September 2019
+ **Notes** - One of those days today.  Just time for a session of coding in Python - refresher on lists and mutability. 
+ **Technologies Used** - Python

### R3D22:  Thursday 5th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Form processing and handling is hard and I'm finding it tough but this is why I'm putting these hours in now. I've started on new technique in a new script and will see how this goes.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, PHP

### R3D21:  Wednesday 4th September 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Making progress every day with my Form Project.  My main win was writing my script to react differently depending on what or if any values are submitted to my forms.  
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, PHP

### R3D20:  Tuesday 3rd September 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Wrote a form that validates Email, website and otherwise text inputs on Server side. Main question: I'm researching if it is possible in PHP to prevention submission of form if validation fails.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

### R3D19:  Monday 2nd September 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Back in action after a short break! I've done some work organising my web forms project. The annoying thing was I lost some of my local databases as I had to reinstall my local server. All set now though.  The Python script I mentioned on Day 18 is also progressing.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

### R3D18:  Friday 23rd August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Time to get back into some other projects today.  It's time I did some proper practice and research into server side form validation.  I have many projects that could benefit from this.
  + Elsewhere I got started on a command line Python App that serves as an interface for a ticket purchase app.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

### **R3D17:** Thursday 22nd August 2019
+ **Notes**
  + I can announce my latest website is live as of a few minutes ago. For Route Office Supplies Ltd.  I've been working hard on this for the past few weeks and I have a very happy client. Built in SASS, HTML5 with a dash of embedded JS.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5

### **R3D16:** Wednesday 21st August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + I'm Cricket mad this summer.  I wrote a small script in Python in about 10 minutes that calculates the batting run rate based on inputs of total runs and overs used.
+ **Technologies Used** - Python

### **R3D15:** Tuesday 20th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + I can announce my latest website is live as of a few minutes ago. For Route Office Supplies Ltd.  I've been working hard on this for the past few weeks and I have a very happy client. Built in SASS, HTML5 with a dash of embedded JS. After finishing up first website draft for evaluation to my client, I found some time to get into some Python Practice  :)  #100DaysOfCode
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

### **R3D14:** Monday 19th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Website now starting to take shape. I hope by tomorrow to present it for first evaluation to my client!

  + Approaching the final stages of the website.  Adding transitions, responsive images and a google map to the site.  Hoping to finish the project by the end of the next week.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5 

### **R3D12:** Thursday 15th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Really pleased to have coded the layout in both Grid and standard layout.  Grid works better but I'll certainly be reviewing browser support before releasing that version. Now to build the rest of the site!
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5 

### **R3D11:** Wednesday 14th August 2019

+ **Notes** - 
  + Got the responsive layout for the website sorted.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5 

### **R3D10:** Tuesday 13th August 2019

+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5 

### **R3D9:** Monday 12th August 2019

+ **Notes** - 
  + Started the styling for the next web project. Lots of gruelling testing and trial and error but the fundamentals of the layout seem to be in place.  I am considering just going ahead and using CSS Grid.  Support may not be 100% but it might be easier to put together  :)
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5  

### **R3D8:** Friday 9th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Swamped with admin today. But I did have a problem today with some jQuery form validation on a PHP page that simply isn't kicking in.  Unable to determine why yet but it's on my ToDo list.  :)
+  **Technologies Used** - Sass, jQuery, Python

### **R3D7:** Thursday 8th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Finally got into some coding for Python exceptions in the last couple of days; the difference between catching and raising.  Elsewhere my day has been about exporting and testing dozens of video drafts. 
    
+ **Technologies Used** - Python, Sass

### **R3D6:** Wednesday 7th August 2019
