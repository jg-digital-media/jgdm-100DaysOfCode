## R3D49:  Monday 14th October 2019
+ **Notes** - Spent most of today starting on some important updates to the front end for a client. Hopefully this will be finished by tomorrow.  :)  Found some time for Python OOP inheritance practice too.


+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP, Python

## R3D48:  Friday 11th October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

   + Some updates to my website are now live.  Includes additions to form validation on both the client and server side which means several layers of form validation are now in place.  My website is available as always by logging on to jonniegrieve.co.uk 
   + I'd still like to do further updates to the validation by checking for correct URL's and email addresses via the main form
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

## R3D47:  Thursday 10th October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

   + Client side validation and server side now working in unison. Used jquery to dismiss individual error messages generated by PHP. It requires JS to be switched on but it's a much better user experience
   + Used python to code a simple class as I try once again to get to terms with OOP. Understood the use of \__*dunder*__ methods including \__main\__ and "\__init\__"
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

## R3D46:  Wednesday 9th October 2019
+ **Notes** - Got some simple server side validation sorted on my website now.  2 versions of the form loaded until I can find a better solution, but users will find their forms are saved so they don't have to fill in everything again.  Will be uploaded to server soon!
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

## R3D45:  Tuesday 8th October 2019
+ **Notes** - Took a little while but I've got the basis of some server side validation scripting for the web form on my website. From memory. Got a plan together now for completing the rest. But how to make it a good user experience?
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

## R3D44:  Monday 7th October 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Following on from my form project work I've applied more client side validation to the main form on my website.  Server side will be next up.
  + It was hard to tell if it worked initially however as it seems HTML5 Validation takes priority.  So I removed that for now.  I'll be sure to add that later.
  + 2 more versions of the masterticket python script added today and went on furter to study Python Dictionary syntax..


+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, JavaScript, PHP,  Python

## R3D43:  Friday 4th October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  +  Finished my look into Python sequences, learned the concept of Membership Testing and Concatenation. Next up, Python Dictionaries.
+ **Technologies Used** - Python

## R3D42:  Thursday 3rd October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  +  "Form Project" is live! This is a collection of pages and web forms of various types. https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/form_project/  I wrote a blog about what this project is all about which you can find here!  #100DaysOfCode
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

## R3D41:  Wednesday 2nd October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  + Finally launching "Form Project" tomorrow. Had intended to do it today but had matters elsewhere to attend to. Just been doing some last minute checks which will continue into tomorrow. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

## R3D40:  Tuesday 1st October 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  +  Writing a blog to discuss the "Form Project" I've been working on... what I've been doing, why I've been doing it, what I've learned. why it's been worth doing. So that's most of the #100DaysOfCode I've been doing today.  Also learned a bit more about Python Sequences.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

## R3D39:  Monday 30th September 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  + Coded the styling of error messages on forms today.  Hoping to show you all what I've been working on very soon
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

## R3D38:  Friday 27th September 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  + Big update today. I've found a solution to organise common stylesheets to one directory so I can update the main styles in one place with individual stylesheets in their own place. 
  + I'll still need to run sass --watch commands in several locations to update the different content but it's a good solution. 
  + Where yesterday I learned about Packing in Python today I learned the opposite pattern in unpacking.

+ **Technologies** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

## R3D37:  Thursday 26th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Another round of bug fixes on my form project work.  Felt like I'd gained more understanding of what it is to process good web forms today but still a lot more work to come.  With Python I learned about "packing" arguments in functions.
+ **Technologies** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

## R3D36:  Wednesday 25th September 2019
+ **Notes** - More work on my big "Form project" today. And some practice on returning Python values in functions. Much like Yesterday. I've been going through a round of bugs and inconconsitencies in the code.
+ **Technologies** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

## R3D35:  Tuesday 24th September 2019
+ **Notes** - More work on my big "Form project" today. And some practice on returning Python values in functions.  I think the lightbulb has finally switched on about what returning values actually means.  I've always understood it syntactically but not what it means.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python

## R3D34:  Monday 23rd September 2019
+ **Notes** - I've finally written a suitable form handling script that validates form data OR sends an email. Worked a lot of hours and looked at a lot of tutorials to do it but it's paying off. Looking forward to sharing.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

## R3D33:  Friday 20th September 2019
+ **Notes** - I'm at a loss for this one. There must be a subtle difference in PHP versions causing different behaviour in localhost and online. Why is the redirect not working on successful form submission?
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

## R3D32:  Thursday 19th September 2019
+ **Notes** - 

  + Started a script courtesy of The Art of The Web Tutorials that unless I'm mistaken should pause submission of an email form depending on existence of validation errors. https://www.the-art-of-web.com/php/form-handler/ 
  + Still needs some work. I'm not getting emails returned regardlessThat effort goes on.  :)  Python wise I learned some interesting things about Tuples I wasn't aware of before.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python.

## R3D31:  Wednesday 18th September 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + New example of a server side validated form is up.  It tells us when there are fields that still need filling in and identifies which fields are missing.  Will be working on refining this tomorrow with better styling. https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/form_project/w3schools/index.php 
  + In Python I was able to code a nice command line Shopping List App on pretty much the first go. Am pleased with what I was able to run on my own when prompted 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP, Python.

## R3D30:  Tuesday 17th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Worked mostly on the client side again today and made what I think are some pretty style features for invalid states.  Tomorrow I start thinking about the server side again. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

## R3D29:  Monday 16th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Got some styling back working on for instant validation feedback using JavaScript. Got to work on fixing up the placement of certain fields before I get to more server side validation. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

## R3D28:  Friday 13th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Got some of my form styles back.  I had wanted to structure the project so all the styles lived in one place but with so many form examples used it wasn't practical. So each form example is now its own mini site with its own styles.  Looking forward to continuing to build on this.  
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

## R3D27:  Thursday 12th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Much better day today.  I now have 3 examples of client side validation and 1 example that seems to be working for Server side form validation. I still have a lot to learn about how to get both ends to work together well. But a productive time. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP.

## R3D26:  Wednesday 11th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Did something a little different today. I came by SoloLearn.com today and with it learned some useful things about the DOM, JS Form validation and JS Objects. 
+ **Technologies Used** - JavaScript.

## R3D25:  Tuesday 10th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Most of the forms I'm working on are working. But the CSS Styling in the validation is slightly off and finding out why is tricky.  It's down to some CSS rules overriding another - a drawback of building the project the way I am.  #100DaysOfCode.
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

## R3D24:  Monday 9th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Spend my #100DaysOfCode time today compartmentalising forms and form styling in the hope it'll make this rather large project easier to organise. 
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass, PHP

## R3D23:  Friday 6th September 2019
+ **Notes** - One of those days today.  Just time for a session of coding in Python - refresher on lists and mutability. 
+ **Technologies Used** - Python

## R3D22:  Thursday 5th September 2019
+ **Notes** - Form processing and handling is hard and I'm finding it tough but this is why I'm putting these hours in now. I've started on new technique in a new script and will see how this goes.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, PHP

## R3D21:  Wednesday 4th September 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Making progress every day with my Form Project.  My main win was writing my script to react differently depending on what or if any values are submitted to my forms.  
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, PHP

## R3D20:  Tuesday 3rd September 2019
+ **Notes** -
  + Wrote a form that validates Email, website and otherwise text inputs on Server side. Main question: I'm researching if it is possible in PHP to prevention submission of form if validation fails.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

## R3D19:  Monday 2nd September 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Back in action after a short break! I've done some work organising my web forms project. The annoying thing was I lost some of my local databases as I had to reinstall my local server. All set now though.  The Python script I mentioned on Day 18 is also progressing.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

## R3D18:  Friday 23rd August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Time to get back into some other projects today.  It's time I did some proper practice and research into server side form validation.  I have many projects that could benefit from this.
  + Elsewhere I got started on a command line Python App that serves as an interface for a ticket purchase app.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5, Python

  + I can announce my latest website is live as of a few minutes ago. For Route Office Supplies Ltd.  I've been working hard on this for the past few weeks and I have a very happy client. Built in SASS, HTML5 with a dash of embedded JS.
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5

### **R3D16:** Wednesday 21st August 2019

+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5 

### **R3D12:** Thursday 15th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Really pleased to have coded the layout in both Grid and standard layout.  Grid works better but I'll certainly be reviewing browser support before releasing that version. Now to build the rest of the site!

+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5 

### **R3D9:** Monday 12th August 2019

+ **Notes** - 
  + Started the styling for the next web project. Lots of gruelling testing and trial and error but the fundamentals of the layout seem to be in place.  I am considering just going ahead and using CSS Grid.  Support may not be 100% but it might be easier to put together  :)
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass, HTML5  

### **R3D8:** Friday 9th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Swamped with admin today. But I did have a problem today with some jQuery form validation on a PHP page that simply isn't kicking in.  Unable to determine why yet but it's on my ToDo list.  :)
+  **Technologies Used** - Sass, jQuery, Python

### **R3D7:** Thursday 8th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Finally got into some coding for Python exceptions in the last couple of days; the difference between catching and raising.  Elsewhere my day has been about exporting and testing dozens of video drafts.

+ **Technologies Used** - Python

### **R3D5:** Tuesday 6th August 2019
+ **Notes** -

+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Sass

### **R3D4:** Monday 5th August 2019
+ **Notes** - 
  + Wrote the HTML Content for my latest client project today.  Good to also get into the digital content side of my business too with mockups and Wireframes. Good day today.  :)
  + Managed to fit in some time for Python coding too. 
  
+ **Technologies Used** - HTML5, Python

### **R3D3:** Friday 2nd August 2019 
+ **Notes** - 
  + Most of my coding day involved doing some behind the scenes editing in WordPress.  Itching to show you the full website but that is at my clients behest!  We're content building!
  + Managed to find some time, after Wireframing for another web project to do some Python coding too. Busy day!  :-)
+ **Technologies Used** - WordPress, Python


### **R3D2:** Thursday 1st August 2019 
+ **Notes** -
  + Just time for a few lines of Python code today. Been doing some Wireframes for an incoming web project today
+ **Technologies Used** - Sass,  HTML5, PHP, Python

### **R3D1:** Wednesday 31st July 2019 
+ **Notes** - 
  + Started a refresher on the Basics of Python.  I know the Syntax but one thing I need to get more comfortable with is catching and raising Exceptions. Got to Catch those errors
  + Caught that error with PHP Authentication. The cookie is now passed correctly into those Web Tokens nice and securely. Think I was trying to decode the JWT as JSON causing it to not be read properly.
  + But now on the server it the entire won't connect properly, Error: 500. Fine on localhost.  One step at a time etc  :)
