## Object Oriented JavaScript Practice

Build the 3 classes that are needed for this project

## Treehouse Instructions
----


1) In the Library.js file, add two methods to the Library class: addPatron() and addBook()

2) addPatron() receives one argument, a Patron object. This object (stored in the patron variable) should be added to the Library object's (stored in thelibrary variable) patrons property, which is an array.

3) addBook() receives one argument, a Book object. This object (stored in the book variable) should be added to the Library object's books property, which is an array.
