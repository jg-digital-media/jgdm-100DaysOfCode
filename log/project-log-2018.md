## **Introduction**

I've rejigged my blog to restart my 100DaysofCode challenge.  The last one was a dud, really. I didn't last a week and even then I think I missed a day.  

I won't last 100 straight days this time either, although I intend to complete 100 Days. My goal is to help myself maintain not just my coding (I can always be found coding) but also an active social media presence.   

# LOG

### **Day 48**: Wednesday 14th November 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**
    + Pandas Library in Python
    + JavaScript Regular Expressions (regex)

+ **Progress:**
    + Able to successfully access the data in Pandas DataFrames
    + It took me a while but I also succeeded in finding a regex that matches 0 or more chars in one string but ignores another.  In this case that was possible because in the remaining strings the character only appears once at a time.
+ **Thoughts:**
    + Bit disappointed to have a lost a lot of time to the Regex problem but satisfied to have gotten through it.

### **Day 47**: Tuesday 13th November 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**
    + Get an understanding of Broadcasting in Pandas (Python library) at last
    + Start work on DataFrames
+ **Progress:**
    + I did manage to understand a bit more about what went on with the Broadcasting problem.
+ **Thoughts:** 
    + There seems to be a difference between which operator should be used to Broadcast data depending on the platform you use. Either the ```+``` or ```+=``` operators to return data.
    + Broadcasting returns a new Series (set of data) to work with. 
+ + **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode

### **Day 46**: Monday 12th November 2018

+ **Progress:**  Struggling to work out what's wrong with the Broadcasting in Python Pandas.  Vectorisation in that python file is working as expected but broadcasting is having no effect at all.  I'm not sure why but I'm asking around.   Also working progressing on FreeCodeCamp today.
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode

### **Day 45**: Friday 9th November 2018

+ **Progress:**
  + Added 2 new files today to work with python pandas, specifically with vectorization and broadcasting of data.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + While I see how they both make working with data simpler than having to loop over data all the time, broadcasting isn't yet doing what I expect it to do with the data.  Yet. :)

### **Day 44**: Thursday 8th November 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** profile lookup script
+ **Progress:**
  + Completed the first section of the JavaScript certification in FreeCodeCamp.  
  + Tackled the profile lookup example. Added the script to the ```javascript``` directory - ```profile-lookup.js``` 
  + Did a bit more with Python Pandas as well carrying on from Day 43.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Today was one of those days I reached a low point ("I'm not cut out for programming" moments).  When I get these thoughts I just disregard it. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses and every day is a learning day.
  + Looking forward to tackling more problems to exercise the programming brain.
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode


### **Day 43**: Wednesday November 7th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**  Take a look at The Python Library Pandas - which is built on Numpy.
+ **Thoughts:**
  + With my brain it really is difficult for me to Switch tasks but i couldn't wait to get ito the Pandas library
  + So I went away, had a little break (another project, not an actual break) simply did ```pip install pandas```
  + The error went away

### **Day 42**: Tuesday November 6th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Working on basic vanilla JavaScript via FreeCodeCamp
+ **Progress:** Added a new working script -card-counting-blackjack.js
+ **Thoughts:** Followed the read/search/ask rule again. But it's funny how sometimes when you start to ask the question the answer just comes to you.  (So I didn't end up asking).   Basically my conditions were messed up, so while they didn't crash the code in the console they were giving me incorrect results.  Key takeaway from today: Always combine with || or && operator, not with a comma where multiple values are being tested as the same.
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode


### **Day 41**: Monday November 5th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Working on basic vanilla JavaScript
+ **Progress:**
  + Added a new folder for ```javascript``` in this repo
  + new script completed that works out the correct label for a golf score when returning both the par and the number strokes passed to a function.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Although I was disappointed not to be able to complete it fully on my own I do feel I understand the concept involved. In the end I was getting my variables reversed when putting them through the condition statements... and again, I didn't need to make them so complicated.  A good exercise to keep my JS Skills sharp.
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode



### **Day 40**: Friday November 2nd 2018

Doing work today on the next certification on FreeCodeCamp.  Practice with JavaScript Getters and Setters. 

### **Day 39**: Thursday November 1st 2018

+ **Progress:**  
  + Went slightly off course today. Mostly React.js review then spent some time updating JetBrain's IntelliJ program for Java.  
  + All the Apps, ```context_api```, ```react-rendering```, ```scoreboard```, ```scoreboard_v2```, ```temp``` and ```tictactoe``` contain functional code.
  + Oh yes, and I also did some practice with OOP JavaScript Classes which went well.

+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode


### **Day 38**: Wednesday October 31st 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continue learning React.js
+ **Progress:**
  + Completed my work into the React Context API
  + Added a new directory "react-rendering" to the repository which is a basic of example of using props to render a list of data.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Mixed up on the Syntax of ReactDOM. Render and the various types of components.  But that's okay. Most of the stuff I was able to fix by looking at apps iI've already done. Even if Syntax isn't 100% committed to memory yet, I know where to look for it.
  + I used as many different examples of React Components as I could, for practice. Most of the behaviours of React itself I'm comfortable with now. 
  + Didn't know much about the map method... will need to look into that more closely in the days to come.  
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode


## **Day 37**: Tuesday October 30th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Learn more about the React Context API.
+ **Progress:** 
  + Didn't go well to be honest, I can see how what I've done has simplified the code that you'd write as a React Developer but I wish I understood more about what's going on.  Will be good to compare this to the other 2 iterations of this app.
  + Elsewhere having now pushed the production build to my server I'm having trouble getting a working version from it.  Wish me luck getting behind that problem too.
  + Finally, I've also submitted my first Certification claim to FreeCodeCamp.  Moving on to JavaScript problems soon.  :)
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode

### **Day 36**: Monday October 29th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** React Tic Tac Toe Practice game.
+ **Progress:** Completed most of the game in practice.  Much of this is practice in the basics so wasn't unfamiliar to me. Just about trying to let it sink in.  My notes included in Day 36 notes of ```working.md``` file.
+ **Thoughts:** 
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode



### **Day 35**: Friday October 26th 2018

+ **Progress:** 
  + Much of today was about organising this repository to include 2 new projects. One is a basic TicTacToe game for new practice with React.  
  + Another new project is called ```context-api``` which will explore the Scoreboard app and how it can be used to work with the React Context API.

+ **Thoughts:** 
  + As I understand it from what I've learned earlier today, the React Context API is a feature of React that allows to share props with components without using the whole Component Tree. 
  + Still having trouble getting my FTP unlocked so my previous production build of the Scoreboard App is still not uploaded.

+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode



### **Day 34**: Thursday October 25th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**  Continue learning about Components in React
+ **Progress:** Finished the React Scoreboard App  (yay :O) )
+ **Thoughts:** 

  + Feel like I've demystified what the deal is with PropTypes for the first time and how to use them.
  
  + Added the high score feature but I have to admit, I couldn't do that on my own.  I can build components in React, and I can learn to trigger events in the React way - The nuts and bolts but the functionality behind those events needs more work.

  + Think I've made significant steps forward though. 
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode



### **Day 33**: Wednesday October 24th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continue learning about Components in React
+ **Progress:**  Started refactoring the code to use some React Design patters e.g. A PureComponent, Destructured props and a Ref for the input field.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + This wasn't quite as scary as I thought it was going to be and in particular I liked the syntax for Destructuring props. 
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode


### **Day 32**: Tuesday October 23rd 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continue learning about Components in React
+ **Progress:**  Added the code to visualse the stopwatch on the screen.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + So pleased to have completed this functiinality on my own.  It wasn't the most difficult thing to do on my own I admit but that doesn't matter really.  I feel like it's some sort of progression.
  + I've proven I knew enough about React to manipulate state and learn how call methods on events. Hopefully I can lean on this knowledge when creating my own React projects.
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode


### **Day 31**: Monday October 22nd 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continue learning about Components in React
+ **Progress:**
  + Moved on to lifecycle methods in React.  Progress made in the app.  
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Understand the concept of lifecycle methods which is good.  The app is beginning to grow in code though.  Usually this is the point I start to struggle remembering how these things all come together; specifics not concepts.
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode


### **Day 30**: Friday October 19th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continue learning about Components in React
+ **Progress:**  
  + Add player functionality to component
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + The application is starting to get increasingly complex and harder to get my head around. But is fully functional.
  + Started adding some comment around the biggest component files to help keep track of what everything is doing.
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode


### **Day 29**: Thursday October 18th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** .
+ **Progress:**  Added 2 new components to the scoreboard app.
+ **Thoughts:**
  + Creating React Apps using the build tool **Create React App** is amazing.  Love the feedback you get in the console when you make errors, helping you to spot and fix them easily.
  + Great to learn about Controlled Components in React. About how inputs are stateful elements and need to be assigned a Handler in order to work.

+ **Link to Work:** (https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode) 


### **Day 28**: Wednesday October 17th 2018

+ **Progress:**
  + Refactored the app to move state to application level rather than multiple components with local state.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Difficult one day. Spent a lot of time on React today. Refactored the app and left it functionally the same as yesterday but still a bit hazy with the concepts.
  + things like lifting state up

+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode 


### **Day 27**: Tuesday October 16th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** How to organise React Components to be more modular.
+ **Progress:** Learned about "named" imports and finally have a better understanding of what exports are; what imports are, scope and how ES modules work in React.
+ **Link to Work:** https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode 


### **Day 26**: Monday October 15th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Start working with Create React App to start a React Project.


Well, I thought I've made a bit of a mess of trying to add my Create React App project to the repo. 

Something I probably shouldn't have done anyway but I have untracked files in my Git project folder despite the fact everything seems to be included in the repository. 

And I can't clear them, even after untracking all the files from the root and adding them to the stage again.

Then I simply closed VS Code and restarted. All gone, so I'm assuming this was a caching issue in the text editor and Git.

.gitignore is still in place on my node_modules folder.  Rookie mistakes  :)



### **Day 25**: Friday October 12th 2018

Nothing new in terms of coding today. React Recap.  Everything from Stateless, Functional, Stateful Components.  Props and State.

Also more work on Client website today which is nearly done. Will soon be ready to link to accept Cards via a Online Payment Gateway.  It's been a busy week.  :)

### **Day 24**: Thursday October 11th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**  React Basics - Scoreboard App.
+ **Progress:**  - Completed the App!! :-)  
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Had an issue where the players list wasn't being displayed. No player objects. Apparently, I didn't give the button remove component the proper callback function syntax which meant no props were being passed.

  + Currently the app allows to add (manually), instances of player objects where each instance represents a player name and score.

  + Time spent needed, I think to delve into the application props, state and the React Dev Tools to get more comfortable with these React concepts.

### **Day 23**: Wednesday October 10th 2018


+ **Learning Goals:** Continue learning with the basics of React.JS
+ **Progress:**  - Important Refresher on Application and Component State. Also recapped what I've learned so far in Day 23 entry of ```working.md```
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Most of my day was spent as before yesterday on a website for a client.  I then recapped my thoughts and code snippets for the basics of React. They're currently on Day 23 entry of ```working.md``` in this repository.

  + Updated the scoreboard app to introduce the concept of Application State to the app.

  + Learned how React updates state asyncronously by default for performance reasons.  Passing a callback function to setState() is the way to get around this.
  
+ **Link to Work:** [React Scoreboard](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/react-scoreboard/) 


### **Day 22**: Tuesday October 9th 2018

Worked completely on client work today with CSS, HTML and jQuery.


### **Day 21**: Monday October 8th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Learning about binding React event handlers to components so they actually work.
+ **Progress:** I didn't have a lot of time again today due to client work so I devoted my time to working out ways to bind event handlers in React to Components.  I think I'll have to spend a bit more time on this to sync in but I did get it to work.
+ **Thoughts:** 
+ **Link to Work:** [React Scoreboard](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/react-scoreboard/) 




### **Day 20**: Friday October 5th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** State management in React.
+ **Progress:**  Used state for the first time but looking forward to learning how this actually updates on the screen.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Main takeaway from today is understanding how objects are passed into the ```setState()``` function and this is where code is added that changes the state.  Change state  --> ```render()``` method called.

  + React does not change state directly, even inside of a method. 

  + What's behind the error message when attaching an event to a method?   (Uncaught TypeError)

+ **Link to Work:** [React Scoreboard](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/react-scoreboard/) 

### **Day 19**: Thursday October 4th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**
  + Recapped iterating on an array of objects in React with map();

  + Get a handle on State in React.

  + Start working on Application State
+ **Progress:**
  + learned about the key prop in React for iterating sibling components.   It has to be a "key" for this to work and get rid of the console warning

  + Also converted one of the components to a class component
+ **Thoughts:** 

  + Good session today. I feel like I have a basic but good understanding of what state is, what a "Stateful" component is, how it relates to class components in React; when to use them as opposed to functional components.
  + Examples of each, I've left in ```working.md``` for Day 19.
+ **Link to Work:** [React Scoreboard](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/react-scoreboard/) 


### **Day 18**: Wednesday October 3rd 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** continue with React.js
+ **Progress:** I haven't had a lot of time today so I'm just doing as much with React today as I can but not too much progress made.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + iterate over data to produce a list of elements
  + ```map() ``` - Map takes a callback function that receives and processes each item in the array, one by one, and returns a new array of the processed items.
  + Struggled a bit getting the dynamic data to work. But with some persistance and a little reverse engineering I managed to get passed this on my own steam. Proving my understanding of props is improving.  
+ **Link to Work:** [React Scoreboard](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/react-scoreboard/) 


### **Day 17**: Tuesday October 2nd 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** React Components and how to work with props
+ **Progress:** Edited my code to reuse components with dynamic and unique data to make the scoreboard app look more like a scoreboard :)
+ **Thoughts:** Key takeaways include:
  + left the code using a function expression as my value to totalPlayers prop rather than an integer as I think this is a better example. ``` <Header heading="Scoreboard" totalPlayers={ n => n+1 } />```

  + can omit value of a prop when explicitly true.  e.g. ``isFun``` rather than ```isFun=true ```

+ **Link to Work:** [React Scoreboard](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/react-scoreboard/) 


### **Day 16**: Monday October 1st 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** React Components
+ **Progress:** 
  + Learned about composing components which is basically using one component to refer to other components in an application.  Pleased with my understanding and how I was able to work out how to do this when challenged.

  + I do need more practice writing components though. I'd like to be able to remember how without referring to my previous work.. and stop writing components with the function keyword  :)

+ **Link to Work:** [React Scoreboard](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/react-scoreboard/) 


### **Day 15**: Friday September 28th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**Learn Syntax of React components with basic function and arrow function expression syntax
+ **Progress:**
  + Code snippet examples for both sets of syntax.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + remembering not to use the function keyword if using arrow function expression syntax. Instead simply store as a variable.
+ **Link to Work:** [React Scoreboard](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/react-scoreboard/)



### **Day 14**: Thursday September 27th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** To refresh and learn now to create React elements and Render them with JSX.  How to compile JSX with Babel
+ **Progress:**
  + Understand how to create a React Element and Render to the DOM   
  + Refresh and understand how to write in JSX.  In working Log.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + A lot to think about but I think I'm confident on the absolute basics of React.
  + It's easy on myself to do this as I'm currently compiling via a CDN.  I probably need more practice actually using build tools like Babel.
  + Despite the above, this is just about getting to grips with using the React Library which today, I think has gone well.
+ **Link to Work:** [React Scoreboard](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/react-scoreboard/)


### **Day 13**: Wednesday September 26th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** 
  + Practice making a simple Python Script.   
  + Learn some Web Accessibility Skills.  
  + Reintroduce myself to React.js
+ **Progress:**
  + Added python and react subdirectories to repository
  + Created a new program in python.
  + Notes written about how to create an element in React.  

+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Practicing making a simple program in Python. A "MadLibs" Word Game.  I ended up making 2 as I tried dividing the program into functions and ran into all sorts of errors relating to variable scope.
  
  + As with any program that takes input, it does mean errors need to be checked for and handled so can look into doing that too. But for now I simply wrote a copy of the program that doesn't use functions as the script was so small, it didn't really need them anyway. 
  
  + React started out as a library for building interfaces in the browser create a react element. -use the createElement() function

  + "React changes frequently"

### **Day 12**: Tuesday September 25th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** 
  + Change of pace today. Most of my day spent motoring through the FreeCodeCamp.
+ **Progress:**  
  + Also finished the main part of the "Four in a Row" Game.  2 players game (same machine for now)
  + Added some custom game messages to instruct on game play.  More to come.   
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + In general, I'm glad of the time I spent on this project.  I think it was very good experience but I do need to spend more time immersing myself in problem solving and OOP JS Projects.  I loved the self directed study aspect of the course I was taking.
+ **Link to Work:** [Project URL](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/four_in_a_row/) 



### **Day 11**: Monday September 24th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** "Four in a Row" JavaScript Game
+ **Progress:** Almost finished with the game but really struggling with confidence today.  Thoughts below.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Feel like I've taken the project as far as I can. The development of new code and methods is over.  Now it's about debugging which I'll try and tackle for tomorrows goal.

  + Showing my ignorance here I think as I struggled comprehending the requirements of the questions/challenges.  I barely coped but managed to write code before moving on to each challenge.

  + Basically, I can organise my OOP code but game logic is the issue.

  + One key takeaway from the day.  "Store as much as you can in variables. - makes code more succint and easier to read."

+ **Link to Work:** [Project URL](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/four_in_a_row/) 


### **Day 10**: Friday September 21st 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continue development of the four in a row game.
+ **Progress:** Left and Right arrow button press moves the tokens along the board.
+ **Thoughts:** One of those days where I've progressed with the code but not really sure about what I've learned.  This happens when the code expands and I have more to wrap my head around.  But at least the development itself has not stalled.  Pacing myself.
+ **Link to Work:** [Project URL](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/four_in_a_row/) 

### **Day 9**: Friday September 20th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**
  + Review code so far
  + Start handling keyboard events
+ **Progress:**
  + I spent the first part of my time reviewing the code that I've written so far.  Added to Day 9 in working.md file

  + As ready as I'll ever be to understanding the code and being ready to move on.

  + Next, write the methods that actually makes the tokens move along the board.
  
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + As ready as I'll ever be to understanding the code and being ready to move on.

  + So immersed in the project so I feel like I'm learning a lot more than I'm maybe realising.

+ **Link to Work:** [Project URL](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/four_in_a_row/) 
  

### **Day 8**: Wednesday September 19th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Get the initial game state working and showing on the screen.

+ **Progress:**
  + Almost there but it's been a grueling day, today.
  + I spent a lot of time in the last day or 2, wondering why the SVG elements weren't actually appearing on the screen. only been slowly dawning on me that the methods needed to be called.
  + Have to get passed a TypeError on Start button click. Will post my progress in tomorrows entry. 
 
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + One thing that holds me back - i tend to do things "backwards", that is get methods and references to methods mixed up led me up the garden path for a wh
  + Thoughts on ```filter()``` and ```map()``` methods - ```filter()```returns new array of all elements that pass a condition). ```map()```  as above but only the first element is returned
+ **Link to Work:** [Project URL](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/four_in_a_row/) 


### **Day 7**: Tuesday September 18th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Learn about Render methods in JavaScript applications i.e. that is how to display SVG elements to the browser
+ **Progress:** Implement some render methods to get more elements seen on the screen.  This ended up in a slight impasse. No errors to report but not seeing any new elements yet in the browser window.  g this.  :)
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Today has been about attempting to get some svg elements showing on the screen using DOM scripting.  
  + I made what I think was a good attempt in code to get this working on my own but since no difference has been made on screen I'm not sure if I've accomplished it.
  + Will need more work, But it's good I've been able to write code that hasn't really required wholesale refactoring.
+ **Link to Work:** [Four in a row](https://www.jonniegrieve.co.uk/projects/four_in_a_row/index.html)

### **Day 6**: Monday September 17th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continuing with OOP designs. Finish constructor methods, and start rendering the game with DOM interaction.
+ **Progress:**
  + A little bit of DOM interaction finally up at last.
  + The classes and their constructor methods are now ready. Foundations of the game are complete. Still a long way to go.
  
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + I'm really pleased with my attempts today.
  + Every time I'm faced with a new task, impostor syndrome and self doubt overwhelm me and each new thing I am asked to do can seem like a mountain to climb.
  + But I enjoyed being able to make some good attempts And if they were not 100% right.  That's okay. You just iterate  (that is start working again) and researching until it's right.
+ **Link to Work:** [Four in a row](https://www.jonniegrieve.co.uk/projects/four_in_a_row/index.html)

### **Day 5**: Friday September 14th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continue with the 4 in a row project.
+ **Progress:** Definitely my toughest day yet with the four in a row project.  Trying to interpret instructions and just not doing it properly but once explained, I understood more about what was going on. I got through it! 
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + What makes things even more difficult is when my brain is convinced my code is right when the truth is staring me in the face.

  + Key takeaway from today: Learning that not every constructor method needs parameters especially if values are hard coded into them.

+ **Link to Work:** [Link to Repository](https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode) 

### **Day 4**: Thursday September 13th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**
   + Further work on OOP By Example

   + Practice with brainstorming properties of a clas and their constructor methods.

   + Hopefully soon learn how an Application comes together using JavaScript.

+ **Progress:** Wrote the first couple of constructors for the Classes Player and Token.  But most of my time was spent thinking of my own suggestions for state and behaviour to be applied to them.
   
+ **Thoughts:** Felt like I'd made reasonable suggestions for properties and methods that might go in them but the final solutions were simpler than apparently needed in the end.
+ **Link to Work:** [Link to Repository](https://github.com/jg-digital-media/jgdm-100DaysOfCode)

### **Day 3**: Wednesday September 12th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continuation of exploration of forEach methods and to start working on an OOP JavaScript project
+ **Progress:** 
  + Great day today working out some problems with using a forEach loop.  I'm hopeful today the forEach syntax is starting to sink in.

  + Also started my first main project of this code challenge.  Making a "four in a row" game. Everything right now feels okay and not unmanageable. Which could change anytime. :)

+ **Thoughts:** 

  + Using the value parameter and the arrow function Syntax when working with the forEach method.

  + I've rediscovered why debugging is my favourite part of programming. Getting rid of mistakes and working out problems can be so rewarding.

  + After having worked with Python for so long this year, I'm having to retrain my brain not to think of Python Syntax when using condition statements in JavaScript.

### **Day 2**: Tuesday September 10th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Finish Object literal basics practice. Make a start with forEach iteration methods.
+ **Progress:** Finished object literal practice
+ **Thoughts:** 
 
  + Point worth noting, I'm assigning the value of a string property of one object to a new property of the same object
  + Remembering that updating a property the same syntax as adding a new property on the fly.

### **Day 1**: Monday September 10th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** To refresh my knowledge of declaring basic JavaScript objects before moving onto applying the basics to a working example.
+ **Progress:** Good working session with some refreshers on adding different types of properties on an object and how to call them.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + There's always more than one way to work out a programming problem but the key takeaway here is that the easiest way isn't always the best way.
  + One of the reasons I think I struggle so much is because I can over-complicate things in my mind.
  + It is okay and even recommended to rely on documentation when you needed. You don't need to work it all out yourself.
