## *Introduction*

I've rejigged my blog to restart my 100DaysofCode challenge.  The last one was a dud, really. I didn't last a week and even then I think I missed a day.  

I won't last 100 straight days this time either, although I intend to complete 100 Days. My goal is to help myself maintain not just my coding (I can always be found coding) but also an active social media presence.

### **Day 3**: Wednesday September 12th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continuation of exploration of forEach methods and to start working on an OOP JavaScript project
+ **Progress:** 
  + Great day today working out some problems with using a forEach loop.  I'm hopeful today the forEach syntax is starting to sink in.

  + Also started my first main project of this code challenge.  Making a "four in a row" game. Everything right now feels okay and not unmanageable. Which could change anytime. :)

+ **Thoughts:** 

  + Using the value parameter and the arrow function Syntax when working with the forEach method.

  + I've rediscovered why debugging is my favourite part of programming. Getting rid of mistakes and working out problems can be so rewarding.

  + After having worked with Python for so long this year, I'm having to retrain my brain not to think of Python Syntax when using condition statements in JavaScript.

### **Day 2**: Tuesday September 10th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Finish Object literal basics practice. Make a start with forEach iteration methods.
+ **Progress:** Finished object literal practice
+ **Thoughts:** 
 
  + Point worth noting, I'm assigning the value of a string property of one object to a new property of the same object
  + Remembering that updating a property the same syntax as adding a new property on the fly.

### **Day 1**: Monday September 10th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** To refresh my knowledge of declaring basic JavaScript objects before moving onto applying the basics to a working example.
+ **Progress:** Good working session with some refreshers on adding different types of properties on an object and how to call them.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + There's always more than one way to work out a programming problem but the key takeaway here is that the easiest way isn't always the best way.
  + One of the reasons I think I struggle so much is because I can overcomplicate things in my mind.
  + It is okay and even recommended to rely on documentation when you needed. You don't need to work it all out yourself.
