+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

### R4D29:  Wednesday 19 February 2020
+ **Notes** - Expanded the Flashcard App by including another set of JSON data for a second set of flashcards. Also the app looks a little better stylistically now with some edited CSS.

I wish I could have deployed the app with Glitch.com but the online app won't seem to accept my file uploads.  Back to Heroku I go. 

+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

### R4D28:  Tuesday 18 February 2020

+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

### R4D27:  Monday 17 February 2020

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, Express.js, HTML5, CSS

### R4D22:  Monday 10 February 2020
+ **Notes** - Fixed the problem with 1 route then introduced another as I learn about Route parameters in Express.  Route params are partially working but the main route now causes 404 error. Still have a bit more to learn about these though.  

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, Express.js, Sonic Pi

### R4D21:  Friday 07 February 2020
+ **Notes** - Made the Express.js code a lot more organised. The app remains functional but there's one route in the app that still does not work.  Trying to get help to work out why that might be.

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, Express.js

### R4D20:  Thursday 06 February 2020
+ **Notes** -  
  + Finished the basic skeleton of an Express app. So happy with what I've learned about doing so far. Now I feel like the real hard work is about to begin.

  + Sometimes all it takes to fix your problem is to come back another day!  Last night I commented out the breaking code from yesterday and committed the last working version of the Express app.  I then re-entered the code and it worked.

  + Also today I wrote some Ruby in Sonic Pi to make a nice little jingle for some video Idents I'm creating.

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, Express.js, Sonic Pi

### R4D19:  Wednesday 05 February 2020
+ **Notes** -  Having a bit of trouble with Express middleware today. I managed to make a working commit that tells Express an error has occoured but error handling needs more work.  Happy to make it this far. :)

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, Express.js

### R4D18:  Tuesday 04 February 2020
+ **Notes** -  Got some routes to successfully redirect and have a functioning simple app now.  Now diving and learning what Middleware is all about. Not as intimidating as I imagined.

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, HTML5, Sonic Pi

### R4D15:  Thursday 30th January 2020
+ **Notes** -  Completed the Request/Response cycle for my app in Express.  I also sent some texts from the Twilio API in Python using Glitch.com. Glitch is the answer to my prayers as to somewhere to serve Node Apps.  :)

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, PUG, Python

### R4D14:  Wednesday 29th January 2020
+ **Notes** -  I introduced myself to the put method in Express routing for handling user interaction and made sure my Pug templates were organised. Looking forward to learning a bit more about Express's Request and Response objects. Thw express website/app is taking shape!  :)

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, PUG, Sonic Pi

### R4D13:  Tuesday 28th January 2020
+ **Notes** - Built a bit more into the Express app. 3 routes now served and templates now use logic and loops using Pug as the template engine. 

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, PUG

### R4D12:  Monday 27th January 2020
+ **Notes** - Added Pug as a templating engine for an express.js site.  Everything serving properly except for the CSS.  As for Heroku still not getting to grips with this. my CLI is not even picking up the Heroku command! 

+ **Technologies used** - Node.js, PUG

### R4D11:  Friday 24th January 2020
+ **Notes** - Decided to change tac slightly today and rediscover my love and appreciation of Sonic Pi. Have a listen to this live code music piece I DJ'ed this afternoon! I'm clearly not as talented as actual musicians but I am rather proud of this piece of work! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEmMpHZCsYI

The thumbnail is the code that does the magic. You edit the code on the fly to change the music. You have to be be on your toes and quick about it, mind!

I hope you like it! I ended making my first attempt at recording a live coding piece.  It's online here!   Perhaps not the most exciting but I'm proud of it as an attempt. (You have to be quick off the mark to live code)

+ **Technologies used** - Ruby, Sonic Pi


### R4D10:  Thursday 23rd January 2020
+ **Notes** - 
  + Thread:  Spent a lot of hours trying to deploy an Express app with 2 routes to HerokuThere seems to be an application error at the moment but it's up there and certainly loads properly on localhost. https://pacific-inlet-81790.herokuapp.com/
  + There are 2 routes up there right now, which each write a simple HTML response. 
  + Not the grand announcement I had planned and I realise it's not the most exciting of apps. But it's a deployment. Hopefully tomorrow I can start getting to the bottom of why Heroku won't show the site when Git's repository reports no errors with the push.

+ **Technologies used** - node.js, JavaScript API

### R4D09:  Wednesday 22nd January 2020
+ **Notes** - Created an Express App with 1 route and local server. Found the Heroku platform for later deploying a Node/Express App but eventually still want to host my own. And I added a little more to my Greensock animation, separating animation methods into separate "scenes"

+ **Technologies used** - node.js, JavaScript API

### R4D08:  Tuesday 21st January 2020
+ **Notes** -
  + Fixed the API issue from yesterday. I'm at an impasse with the other problem though so I've decided to set it aside and delve into working with Express.js projects.  I will be returning to it though.

+ **Technologies used** - node.js, API

### R4D07:  Monday 20th January 2020
+ **Notes** -
  + Was able to request last message from Twilio API in a small node.js project. But not when trying to apply environment variables. Odd that this should be so problematic as the dot file is solid and I can see that the variables are set.

+ **Technologies used** - node.js, API


### R4D06:  Friday 17th January 2020
+ **Notes** -
  + I know a bit now about how to use an API using postman. Most of the issues I had with using the Twilio API were about incorrectly named variables. Messages successfully sent to my phone

+ **Technologies used** - API

### R4D05:  Thursday 16th January 2020
+ **Notes** -
  + Started learning about Greensock .timeline() methods for animation.  I'm doing the James Bond Gunbarrel lsequence. Took some time but I managed to sort out the first part. Node.js is going well too, getting routes to handle html files.

+ **Technologies used** - JavaScript, Node.js

### R4D04:  Wednesday 15th January 2020
+ **Notes** - 
  + Made a simple Greensock animation for practice. So much more to delve into there. https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/greensock/sunrise/  With node.js I got the user route successfully requesting data from an API.

+ **Technologies used** - JavaScript, Node.js

### R4D03:  Tuesday 14th January 2020
+ **Notes** - 
  + Busy one today! Quick Thread. Had the pleasure of looking into a great framework I found via CSS-Tricks - Greensock for Web animation.  Lots to explore there.
  + Looked into the Twilio API and managed to use it to send a text message to my phone via the Web console and my Git Bash Terminal.  Using the PostMan app was a step too far but tomorrow's another day!
  + Used node.js to set up 2 Node Routes with one static data, one that uses a variable.  This will later be used to populate with data from the Treehouse API.  Basically like I tried before Christmas  (and I still want to host it somewhere!)

+ **Technologies used** - API, JavaScript, Node.js

### R4D02:  Monday 13th January 2020
+ **Notes** - 
  + Made a start exploring an example of an API... the Spotify API using Craig Dennis's course via YouTube.  Then went on to make sure I have a localhost server running via Node.js

+ **Technologies used** - API, JavaScript, Node.js

### R4D02:  Friday 10th January 2020
+ **Notes** - 
  + I've started Round 4 of the challenge a few day early! Round 3 kinda ran out of steam.  :)
  + Built the directories and ground work for a project examining api's
  + Goals for this round include continuing to learn Express and Node and building for projects that use an API.
  + minor updates performed to my website

+ **Technologies used** - HTML5, Sass, Markdown
