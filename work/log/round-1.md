# 100 Days of Code - Round 1.   

### **Status:** Day 1 of 100.  **Last Update:**  04 September 2023

## **Introduction**

After an extended break, I am once more logging my Coding Journey via #100DaysOfCode. The last one was a dud, really. I didn't last a week and even then I think I missed a day.  

I won't last 100 straight days this time either, although I intend to complete 100 Days. My goal is to help myself maintain not just my coding (I can always be found coding) but also an active social media presence.

### Day 1**: Monday September 4th 2023
