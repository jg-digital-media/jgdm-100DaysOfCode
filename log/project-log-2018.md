## *Introduction*

I've rejigged my blog to restart my 100DaysofCode challenge.  The last one was a dud, really. I didn't last a week and even then I think I missed a day.  

I won't last 100 straight days this time either, although I intend to complete 100 Days. My goal is to help myself maintain not just my coding (I can always be found coding) but also an active social media presence.

### **Day 9**: Friday September 20th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**
  + Review code so far
  + Start handling keyboard events
+ **Progress:**
  + I spent the first part of my time reviewing the code that I've written so far.  Added to Day 9 in working.md file

  + As ready as I'll ever be to understanding the code and being ready to move on.

  + Next, write the methods that actually makes the tokens move along the board.
  
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + As ready as I'll ever be to understanding the code and being ready to move on.

  + So immersed in the project so I feel like I'm learning a lot more than I'm maybe realising.

### **Day 8**: Wednesday September 19th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Get the initial game state working and showing on the screen.

+ **Progress:**
  + Almost there but it's been a grueling day, today.
  + I spent a lot of time in the last day or 2, wondering why the SVG elements weren't actually appearing on the screen. only been slowly dawning on me that the methods needed to be called.
  + Have to get passed a TypeError on Start button click. Will post my progress in tomorrows entry. 
 
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + One thing that holds me back - i tend to do things "backwards", that is get methods and references to methods mixed up led me up the garden path for a wh
  + Thoughts on ```filter()``` and ```map()``` methods - ```filter()```returns new array of all elements that pass a condition). ```map()```  as above but only the first element is returned

### **Day 7**: Tuesday September 18th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Learn about Render methods in JavaScript applications i.e. that is how to display SVG elements to the browser
+ **Progress:** Implement some render methods to get more elements seen on the screen.  This ended up in a slight impasse. No errors to report but not seeing any new elements yet in the browser window.  Investigatin this.  :)
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + Today has been about attempting to get some svg elements showing on the screen using DOM scripting.  
  + I made what I think was a good attempt in code to get this working on my own but since no difference has been made on screen I'm not sure if I've accomplished it.
  + Will need more work, But it's good I've been able to write code that hasn't really required wholesale refactoring.

### **Day 6**: Monday September 17th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continuing with OOP designs. Finish constructor methods, and start rendering the game with DOM interaction.
+ **Progress:**
  + A little bit of DOM interaction finally up at last.
  + The classes and their constructor methods are now ready. Foundations of the game are complete. Still a long way to go.
  
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + I'm really pleased with my attempts today.
  + Every time I'm faced with a new task, impostor syndrome and self doubt overwhelm me and each new thing I am asked to do can seem like a mountain to climb.
  + But I enjoyed being able to make some good attempts And if they were not 100% right.  That's okay. You just iterate  (that is start working again) and researching until it's right.

### **Day 5**: Friday September 14th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continue with the 4 in a row project.
+ **Progress:** Definitely my toughest day yet with the four in a row project.  Trying to interpret instructions and just not doing it properly but once explained, I understood more about what was going on. I got through it! 
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + What makes things even more difficult is when my brain is convinced my code is right when the truth is staring me in the face.

  + Key takeaway from today: Learning that not every constructor method needs parameters especially if values are hard coded into them.

### **Day 4**: Thursday September 13th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:**
   + Further work on OOP By Example

   + Practice with brainstorming properties of a clas and their constructor methods.

   + Hopefully soon learn how an Application comes together using JavaScript.

+ **Progress:** Wrote the first couple of constructors for the Classes Player and Token.  But most of my time was spent thinking of my own suggestions for state and behaviour to be applied to them.
   
+ **Thoughts:** Felt like I'd made reasonable suggestions for properties and methods that might go in them but the final solutions were simpler than apparently needed in the end.

### **Day 3**: Wednesday September 12th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Continuation of exploration of forEach methods and to start working on an OOP JavaScript project
+ **Progress:** 
  + Great day today working out some problems with using a forEach loop.  I'm hopeful today the forEach syntax is starting to sink in.

  + Also started my first main project of this code challenge.  Making a "four in a row" game. Everything right now feels okay and not unmanageable. Which could change anytime. :)

+ **Thoughts:** 

  + Using the value parameter and the arrow function Syntax when working with the forEach method.

  + I've rediscovered why debugging is my favourite part of programming. Getting rid of mistakes and working out problems can be so rewarding.

  + After having worked with Python for so long this year, I'm having to retrain my brain not to think of Python Syntax when using condition statements in JavaScript.

### **Day 2**: Tuesday September 10th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** Finish Object literal basics practice. Make a start with forEach iteration methods.
+ **Progress:** Finished object literal practice
+ **Thoughts:** 
 
  + Point worth noting, I'm assigning the value of a string property of one object to a new property of the same object
  + Remembering that updating a property the same syntax as adding a new property on the fly.

### **Day 1**: Monday September 10th 2018

+ **Learning Goals:** To refresh my knowledge of declaring basic JavaScript objects before moving onto applying the basics to a working example.
+ **Progress:** Good working session with some refreshers on adding different types of properties on an object and how to call them.
+ **Thoughts:** 
  + There's always more than one way to work out a programming problem but the key takeaway here is that the easiest way isn't always the best way.
  + One of the reasons I think I struggle so much is because I can overcomplicate things in my mind.
  + It is okay and even recommended to rely on documentation when you needed. You don't need to work it all out yourself.
