        <p class="client-testimonial"><strong>Barry: </strong>I’d like to thank you for the great job you did on re-building my website www.Psychic-Reading-Online.com. As you know it had been originally built nearly ten years ago and although it was up-to-date back then it sadly lacked the look, feel and behind the scene technology needed for a website that’s able to survive in this competitive world.  <br />
        On a personal level I think that your patience and endurance to overcome complex technical problems shines through.</p>
