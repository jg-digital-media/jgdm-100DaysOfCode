## Description

My goal remains to help myself maintain not just my coding (I can always be found coding), but also an active social media presence in as a result of it. I had lost my way in keeping up with `100DaysOfCode` in the past but particularly as coding is moving swiftly into the AI age, it feels like a good time to go again with it.

Hopefully this will help me again engage more with the tech community.

As of my commit on `01st July 2025`. You'll find all my blogs are now located in the `log` directory. This latest #100DaysOfCode effort is now logged in `round-1.md`. I've kept the others in **round-1.md** and **round-11.md** of the previous iteration as a record in the archive directory of this repository.

All my projects are either backed up on my server, on Amazon AWS (S3) or on version control. Most of my repos are now set to private. I may end up switching back to public from time to time. But don't worry, anything I deem fit for public viewing will be available to see via my domain at [https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk](https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk).

If you notice ```codersnotes-r1.md``` and all the others in this repository, just think of these as a kind of "notebook" for use while I'm working through eachround of `#100DaysofCode`.
