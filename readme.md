## Description


My goal remains to help myself maintain not just my coding (I can always be found coding), but also an active social media presence in as a result of it.

Hopefully this will help me engage more with the tech community.

As of my commit on **30th September 2021** You'll find all my blogs are now located in the "log" directory. This latest #100DaysOfCode effort is now logged in round-6.md. I've kept the others in **round-1.md** and **round-2.md** etc as a record in the archive directory of this repo.

In my commit for 25th January 2019, I posted that I've completed my reorganisation of my work via [GitHub](https://github.com/jg-digital-media) All my projects are either backed up on my server, on Amazon S3 or on version control. Most of my repos are now set to private. I may end up switching back to public from time to time. But don't worry, anything I deem fit for public viewing will be available to see via my domain at https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk.

If you notice ```codersnotes-r8.md``` and all the others in this repository, just think of this as a kind of "notebook" for use while I'm working through this round of #100DaysofCode.
